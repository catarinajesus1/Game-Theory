    "#The code is a game theory situation that simulates the decision-making process surrounding a country and the rest of the world to vaccinate against covid-19 and the implications of not doing it. \n",
    "#The game begins by asking the player if they want to play with the computer. There are 2 choices, “yes” or “no”, if the player answers something else, it will prompt the player again until a valid response is given. \n",
    "#If the player decides to play, the game will ask for a name of a country followed by a table with potential outcomes for that country and the rest of the world based on whether they choose.\n",
    "#The game prompts the player to choose whether or not the country should adopt the vaccine and generates a random choice for the computer´s decision. The game uses a payoff matrix to give a final answer regarding the choices, allocating points, accordingly, printing out the results, and the points earned by each.\n",
    "#If the player doesn’t decide to play, the computer it will play by itself, choosing randomly a country followed by a table with the potential outcomes for that country and the rest of the world based on whether they choose.\n",
    "#The game will generate a random choice for both computers to choose whether or not the country should adopt the vaccine. The game uses a payoff matrix to give a final answer regarding the choices, allocating points, accordingly, printing out the results, and the points earned by each. Finally, the game will generate a winner after running 5 times. \n"
