# Game-Theory

This undertaking focuses on exploring game theory and its implementation in Python programming. 

The objective involved crafting a rendition of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, requiring two participants to make choices between cooperation and defection. The program prompts the user to decide whether they wish to engage in a game against the computer or observe two "Python players" employing distinct strategies in the gameplay.
